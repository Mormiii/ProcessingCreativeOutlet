Processing projects, scripts.

Just copy the content of the .js file (there is always one inside a project library) and you can run it here: https://editor.p5js.org/

If you are have Processing application, then you can open the .js file there directly. (change to p5.js mode)

Remark: In case of any questions, advices, wishes, pls dont hesitate to contact me. THX!
